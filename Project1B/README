Project1B is divided into two main parts :
	- Passing input and output over a TCP socket
	- Compressing communication between the client and server

lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server.c are implemented so that they can communicate
over TCP/IP socket.

##################
# lab1b-client.c #
##################

Client accpets three options : --port, --log, --compress

It starts with non-canonical terminal as Project1A and receives input
from STDIN and send input to TCP socket while echoing to the display.

When --log option is given, it writes whatever data it is receiving/sending to log file description.

When --compress option is given, it compresses/decompresses the input/output data to/from the socket using zlib library.


##################
# lab1b-server.c #
##################

Server accpets three options : --port, --shell, --compress

It starts with creating two pipes(to_shell, from_shell) then create child process
that will execute shell using fork(). Server reads data from TCP/IP socket and
send data to shell using to_shell pipe. Then shell reads data from to_shell pipe and sends data using from_shell pipe. Then parent process reads data from from_shell pipe.

When --shell option is given, child process execute whatever program that --shell
option specified. If --shell is not give, it automatically uses /bin/bash as default.

When --compress option is given, it compresses/decompresses the input/output data to/from the socket using zlib library.


Makefile

default : create executable files(server and client)
server	: create server executable file
client	: create client executable file
dist	: create tarball
clean	: remove all files created by Makefile
