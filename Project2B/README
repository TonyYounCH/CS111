Project2B is divided into two main parts :
	- Writing multithreaded application that performs parallel updates to a 
	shared variable
	- Writing a multithreaded application that performs parallel updates to
	a sorted doubly linked list data structure


##################
#  lab2_list.c   #
##################

lab2_add accpets four options : --threads=#, --iterations=#, --yield=[idl], --sync=[m,s], --lists=#

It processes arguments and retrieve threads and iterations numbers to create 
threads. Based on yield and sync option, threads will perform insert/delete/lookup to doubly linked list wrapped with mutex lock or spin lock. 
After all operations are done, it will print out :

test, threads, iterations, list, num_operations, run_time, avg_per_op


##################
#  SortedList.c  #
##################

Implement all four methods described in SortedList header file. Interface includes three software-conterolled yield options. 
Identify the critical section in each of four methods and add calls to pthread_yield or sched_yield, controlled by the yield options:

in SortedList_insert if opt_yield & INSERT_YIELD
in SortedList_delete if opt_yield & DELETE_YIELD
in SortedList_lookup if opt_yield & LOOKUP_YIELD
in SortedList_length if opt_yield & LOOKUP_YIELD

Descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about my submission that I would like to bring to attention (e.g. research, limitations, features, testing methodology).

QUESTIONS

QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:

	Q : Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?

	A : If there are many iterations, it will take more than thread's time slice
	to finish its work and get interrupted. When interrupted, the race condition
	error will happen casuing the resulting value to be inconsistent.

	Q : Why does a significantly small number of iterations so seldom fail?

	A : With a small number of iterations, the thread is likely to finish its job within its time slice, thus not interrupted. 

QUESTION 2.1.2 - cost of yielding:

	Q : Why are the --yield runs so much slower?
	
	A : Because it takes some time to interrupt and switch to another thread

	Q : Where is the additional time going?

	A : Switching between threads

	Q : Is it possible to get valid per-operation timings if we are using the --yield option?

	A : It is not possible, since extra time that is not related to operation will be added to timing. 

QUESTION 2.1.3 - measurement errors:
	
	Q : Why does the average cost per operation drop with increasing iterations?

	A : Since iterations compensate for the overhead that occurs from creating a new thread. 

	Q : If the cost per iteration is a function of the number of iterations, how do we know how many iterations to run (or what the "correct" cost is)?

	A : To find what the "correct" cost is, we can keep increasing the number of iterations until it reachs some level of stability.  

QUESTION 2.1.4 - costs of serialization

	Q : Why do all of the options perform similarly for low numbers of threads?

	A : If there are low numbers of threads, there will be low contention for a resource which leads to less time spent waiting for a lock. If there is less overhead, they perform well and similarly.

	Q : Why do the three protected operations slow down as the number of threads rises?

	A : For each protected operations whether they use mutex, spin-lock or compare and swap, threads will have to wait for a resource to be released causing more overhead. This slows down the performance.

QEUSTION 2.2.1 - scalability of Mutex

	Q : Compare the variation in time per mutex-protected operation vs the number of threads in Part-1 (adds) and Part-2 (sorted lists).
	Comment on the general shapes of the curves, and explain why they have this shape

	A : As the number of threads increases, cost per operation seems to increase in both Part 1 and Part 2 since the contention for the resources rises.

	Q : Comment on the relative rates of increase and differences in the shapes of the curves, and offer an explanation for these differences.

	A : The rate of increase in Part 2 is larger than Part 1 because Part2  has more operations (insert, delete, lookup) compared to Part 1 (Add) which lead threads to spend more time waiting.

QUESTION 2.2.2 - scalability of spin locks

	Q : Compare the variation in time per protected operation vs the number of threads for list operations protected by Mutex vs Spin locks. 
	Comment on the general shapes of the curves, and explain why they have this shape

	A : As number of threads increases, cost per operations protected by Mutex and Spin locks both increases since the contention for the resources rises.

	Q : Comment on the relative rates of increase and differences in the shapes of the curves, and offer an explanation for these differences.

	A : The rate of increase in spin locks is larger than that in mutex. This is because, spin lock forces thread to wait for the resource for its entire time cycle where mutex puts threads into sleep while waiting.
