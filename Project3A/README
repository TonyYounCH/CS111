The main purpose of this project is to understand the data format of the EXT2 file system and implement a working program that analyzes the file system in the file and outputs a summary to standard out (describing the super block, groups, free-lists, inodes, indirect blocks, and directories).

##################
#    lab3a.c     #
##################

It contains dummmy code that defines mraa variables and functions in case -DDUMMY option is specified when compiling. If so, it uses pre-defined functions instead of ones from mraa.h and mraa/aio.h in order to deal with not-working mraa-[gpio, aio] mapping. 

The program accepts three options (period=#, scale=[C, F], log=filename). If not specified, period and scale are allocated with default value of 1 and F.

It first initializes sensors (temp sensor and button) and for every period, it prints out time and current temperature in C or F depending on current scale. 

Then, we use poll to read from stdin and process whatever input to change current status (START/STOP, PERIOD, SCALE...).

#    Makefile    #

default : compile your program (with the -Wall and -Wextra options) to produce an executable named lab3a
dist : create the deliverable tarball
clean : delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile.
