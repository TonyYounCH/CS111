The main purpose of this project is to reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, and free space. and to gain experience examining, interpreting and processing information in complex binary data structures.
I am to implement a module to analyze file system summary.

##################
#    lab3b.py    #
##################

This module analyzes a given csv file (file system summary) and reports all inconsistencies (damaged items). 

	INVALID
	RESERVED
	UNREFERENCED
	ALLOCATED ON FREELIST
	UNALLOCATED NOT ON FREELIST
	DUPLICATE
	INODE LINKCOUNT
	DIRECTORY INODE (different)


##################
#    Makefile    #
##################

default : build your program to produce an executable named lab3b
dist : create the deliverable tarball
clean : delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile, and return the directory to its freshly un-tar-ed state.

##################
#     README     #
##################

Descriptions of each of the included files and any other information about my submission that I would like to bring to attention (e.g. research, limitations, features, testing methodology).

#################
#   reference   #

Skeleton code from Discussion 1A/B.
