The main purpose of this project is to implement an embedded application that interacts with a central control server with the aid of server-side logs and to implement a secure channel using standard tools.

#  lab4c_tcp.c   #
##################

It contains dummmy code that defines mraa variables and functions in case -DDUMMY option is specified when compiling. If so, it uses pre-defined functions instead of ones from mraa.h and mraa/aio.h in order to deal with not-working mraa-[gpio, aio] mapping. 

The program accepts five options (period=#, scale=[C, F], log=filename, host=hostname, id=#). If not specified, period and scale are allocated with default value of 1 and F. Others are mandatory.

This program runs on a Beaglebone and opens TCP connection and sends commands over this connection
